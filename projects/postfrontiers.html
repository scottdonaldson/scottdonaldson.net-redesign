By 2019, we predict the forces of capital and automation, bolstered by a Republican pro-free-market administration, will have expanded greatly. In late 2016, Uber's automated vehicles began picking up passengers off the streets of Pittsburgh. The centerpiece of the Post-Frontiers Conference 2019 is a presentation by two researchers from the Kalanick Center for Automation (played by myself and my partner, Edward Holthaus) on the application of automated vehicles and machine learning to crowd control.

In this performative, critical piece, we wrote a script for our presentation, using industry jargon with ample acronyms, and peppered our language with dog whistles and references to contemporary political and social issues.

        <p>For the physical computing aspect of the project, we programmed a 3pi to be remotely controlled and move about on a tabletop. We wrapped it with magnets and laser cut figures representing protesters, also containing magnets, which would be repelled when the 3pi "car" got close enough.</p>
        <p>We presented the "car" as operating based off of algorithms derived from machine learning trained on herding data. While this was meant to emphasize the dehumanizing aspects of law enforcement responses to protesters, we also learned that this has real precedents in crowd psychology research.</p>

To make the experience more immersive, we created a website with a full schedule of speakers and a Twitter account that began tweeting one week before our presentation.

## Lessons

As a critical project, the Post-Frontiers Conference offers a relatively pessimistic view of the future of technology and the role of innovation in society. But in the (as of this writing) weeks since the 2016 election, it's become more clear to me, at least, that hope and optimism are necessary tools. If it's ever more difficult to envision futures that are not determined primarily by technological forces (or the domination of society by the technologically empowered), than it's all the more important to present hopeful futures.

Post-Frontiers 2019 is not a hopeful future. But I hope in other projects to explore other speculative provocations that offer different perspectives on technology and society.
