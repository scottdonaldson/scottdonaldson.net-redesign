Recently I went out with the [D.C. Urban Sketchers](http://urbansketchers-dc.blogspot.com/) two weekends to do some drawing. The first day we met at the Old Post Office Pavilion for both the impressive atrium and the views from one of the highest points in the city. The second day is from the National Gallery --- again, outside and in.

<p class="caption aligncenter">The main staircase in the atrium of the Old Post Office Pavilion has these great wrought-iron bannisters. I used Micron 0.5mm and 0.8mm pens over pencil with a Prismacolor 60% gray marker for shading.</p>

<p class="caption aligncenter">From the tower, you get a great view of D.C. from Capitol to Washington Monument and beyond. I captured this sketch of the fantastically brutalist FBI Headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue, though the cold cut it short — I hadn’t brought gloves and the tower is pretty exposed.</p>

<p class="caption aligncenter">The entrance of the National Gallery is right on Constitution Avenue, in the middle of the National Mall.
