The second project (that is, before the <a href="/painting-final-project/">final project</a>) of my painting class was to create a reproduction of a painting from between the Renaissance and the mid-19th century. I chose Anthony van Dyck's <a href="## assets ##/2008/11/amaryllis_mirtillo.jpg">"Amaryllis and Mirtillo"</a> (1631), a painting based on Giovanni Battista Guarini's 1590 poem <a href="http://www.unc.edu/~coluzzi/guarini/pastorfido.htm">"Il Pastor Fido"</a> (The Faithful Shepherd). The scene depicts lots of people kissing, and is pretty sexy (and luckily for me, the assignment was not to do a lot of research based on the work. I picked for my detail reproduction the two kissing figures just left of center in the painting. Here's my painting:

This piece is in oil also, although I started out the term working mainly in watercolor. I'm not totally happy with how it turned out, but it was a good experience for exploring oil as a medium and trying to draw on Van Dyck and the Flemish Baroque style of realism and paint application. I'll put up some of the work from the first project of the class soon.
