The most disappointing thing about Austria (and possibly all of Europe) is, hands down, the fact that whipped cream is not sweet like in America. I'm having a hot chocolate right now and while the drink is delicious, I threw up a little bit in my mouth when I had the whipped cream. But it has overall been a good trip so far...

Anyway, a lot has happened since I wrote a week-ish ago. My Dad and I visited Chicago and took a few obligatory Bean pictures, and went into the Art Institute. I flew to Vienna via Frankfurt. Since then? It's been art museum after art museum after hot chocolate. Vienna is all about historic elements in their buildings. I breathe an audible sigh of relief upon entering a building designed after World War II. <a href="## assets ##/2008/12/dsc02038.jpg">This picture</a> is of an entrance to a parking garage, to give you a sense of the decoration everywhere.

In the room that I'm staying in, there is this drawing of a cat:

The Parliament building in Vienna is undergoing renovations, and for some reason there's a decent-sized house perched on top of it. It's either for the workers, or it's an artistic intervention:

More to come soon, I promise!
