As outlined in the last post, for the last few weeks I've been working on a large (5'6" x 8'6") map of the continental United States, fitting figures into each state's outline. It's finished! Complete with pictures! Those you can find below. The states are off-white acrylic (which I think worked much better against a masonite background than white gesso would have), and the figures are oil. I didn't use any models for this project, as many of the poses are awkward, uncomfortable, and just a little too sexy.

	<li><a href="http://strangemaps.wordpress.com">Strange Maps</a> -- Updated pretty regularly, this site collects maps, real and fictional, and provides tons of research and background information for each post. <a href="http://strangemaps.wordpress.com/2008/05/13/272-missouri-the-shred-me-state/">This post</a> in particular is related to my project, and I think I was probably unconsciously inspired by the artist, <a href="http://www.frankchimero.com/">Frank Chimero</a>, who did a series of prints in which the shapes of states become objects (I think Illinois and California are particularly fun).</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.radicalcartography.net">Radical Cartography</a> -- Run by cartographer and illustrator Bill Rankin, this site is slightly more geared toward the academics (he's done some cool <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Global_lightning_strikes.png">geographic</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Adams_onis_map.png">historical</a> infographics for Wikipedia), but there's also a lot of creative work. I'm especially a fan of <a href="http://www.radicalcartography.net/?manhattan">The Errant Isle of Manhattan</a>, which places Manhattan in various places around the U.S.</li>

And here's my finished map, hopefully the first of many (check out below for details):
