<p>I hope that everyone who's seen the entire series of <em>The Wire</em> has a favorite scene within it, or a piece that in particular speaks strongly to them. The full run of the show is so rich and has such a broad scope that it would be hard to critically watch in its entirety and not come away with a deep, personal attachment to at least one part of it — whether it be characters (for me, Colvin, Dukie, Bubs), storylines, locations, or individual scenes. The opening scene of season three has really stuck with me, and warranted repeated viewings to try to figure out just what about it I find so important.</p>

<p>The five season openers of <em>The Wire</em> each serve up neat little thematic summaries of the episodes to come. This opening scene is arguably the most relevant to the plot of the coming season as well. Within the largest arc of <em>The Wire</em>'s greater narrative — the slow decline of the Barksdale drug organization and subsequent rise of the Stanfield organization — the demolition of Franklin Terrace marks a literal fall for Barksdale's people, who had been controlling the drug trade within the towers. But rather than having kingpin Avon Barksdale (currently in prison) or his second-in-command Stringer Bell weigh in on the event, this scene offers the perspectives of Poot and Bodie, two low-level dealers within the organization (as well as introducing us to Baltimore Mayor Clarence Royce, an important figure in this season). Poot and Bodie are familiar faces to the audience, and opening with them reinforces the notion that huge policy decisions <em>do</em> affect the working poor, though in unexpected ways &mdash; a key theme throughout the series and especially in season three. Here, though, Poot and Bodie also serve as mouthpieces for two opposing views on architecture and habitation.

<p>As they head toward the presumably well-publicized spectacle of the Franklin Terrace implosion, Poot ruminates on his upbringing in the towers. He waxes nostalgic about memorable experiences, including losing his virginity:</p>
<blockquote>I mean, I’m kinda sad. Them towers be home to me... I done seen some shit happen up in them towers that still make me smile, yo. I caught my first pussy up in there — that girl Shontae.</blockquote>
<p>As a rebuttal, Bodie reminds him that the towers are just structures, "steel and concrete," and argues that the local government should have, in fact, "[blown]... them up a long time ago." To Bodie, the individual memories and meaning Poot has for Franklin Terrace as place is not worthy of consideration (though perhaps of ridicule). He mocks Poot's humanistic sentiments, sarcastically saying that he should make it known that the towers were where he lost his virginity; that the government "Wouldn't... be tearing it down now. They could put a... sign in front... Tourists could take pictures." In Bodie's view, the primary value of architecture is functional and economic — his concern over the towers' demolition is not as a loss of home, but as a shifting work- and marketplace (as the drug trade relocates from the high-rises to the streets). This, he argues, is the more real and pressing problem facing them.</p>

<p>Of course, both are right &mdash; Bodie's claims that this will greatly influence the Barksdale organization's functioning are proven true throughout the season, and Poot's personal experiences in the towers are equally valid, if less far-reaching. It may be easier to see the economic repercussions of urban renewal. It is, however, wrong to dismiss Poot's humanism as irrelevant to the larger conversation surrounding the event. Buildings, after all, regardless of typology, are primarily designed to be used <em>by individuals</em>. The formal qualities that make up structures have an indelible effect on the way we live our lives, and a close examination of our experiences with architecture should in turn inform our choice of the buildings we live in, and those that populate our cities.</p>

<p>This scene demonstrates the complexity of architecture's role within people's lives &mdash; not only as the places of home and work, but as a rich, emotionally-laden reminder of who we are, where we come from, and what we represent — and within the city at large &mdash; again, not only as housing and workplace, but as symbol of existing conditions (Royce: "The Franklin Terrace Towers... came to represent some of this city’s most entrenched problems"), and as barometer for the city's growth or decay ("Are you ready for a new Baltimore?").</p>

<p>Finally, it's impossible to watch this scene and not be reminded of another famous implosion that took place on March 16, 1972: That of the Pruitt-Igoe housing complex in St. Louis (a city, like Baltimore, known for high crime and poverty rates). This opening scene was almost certainly modeled on Pruitt-Igoe &mdahs; plagued by drugs and violence, demolished after failed rehabilitation programs. The depiction within <em>The Wire</em> even resembles Pruitt-Igoe's fall:</p>

<p>The image of towers falling (controlled or no) is an especially potent image in 21st-century America. Though Bodie and Poot each try to deny their feelings (Bodie by watching nonchalantly, Poot by turning away), when the steel and concrete do come crashing down, each can't help but stare in shock and awe. Mayor Royce recognizes the importance placed on the event, and the need to somehow put a positive spin on what is ultimately an acknowledgement of failure. His speech conveys the message of this urban renewal as an act of diligent reform, and, at the end of the countdown, he presses the lever &mdash; signaling to a construction worker to flip another switch and actually activate the detonators. The deceit in the act suggests that Royce's statements on the event are, too, just so many empty words.</p>

<p>At the end of the scene, thematically reflecting Bodie's predictions on the spread of the drug trade throughout the city, unplanned smoke from the towers engulfs the crowd &mdash; mayor, drug dealers, and all. People choke and cough, and neighbors close their windows to protect themselves from the rush of debris. It demonstrates that this removal of architecture is not quite euthanasia: In a true mercy killing, the cancer is killed with the host. Instead, the removal of architecture forces its inhabitants to adapt. Rather than bringing the the drug trade to a halt, the Royce administration has simply forced it to move its business elsewhere &mdash; into the streets, which, in turn, forces others in positions of power (notably Colvin and Carcetti) to readjust policy accordingly. This season of <em>The Wire</em>, rife with the actions of the powers that be having unplanned consequences affecting all strata of society, is introduced perfectly by this scene.</p>
