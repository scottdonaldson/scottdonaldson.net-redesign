After a long, busy winter break, I'm back at school for the next couple of months. Classes start tomorrow. I'll be drawing from life on Mondays and Wednesdays and making a table on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I'm also starting work on my paper and talk on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Loos">Adolf Loos</a>, which I'll probably give sometime around late February. <a href="http://lennydee.wordpress.com">Lenny Dee</a> goes up in mid-February. What else?

In Minnesota's weather-related news, it's much, much colder here than in New Zealand. And apparently I have another reason to hate the cold this winter: I'm allergic to it? <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/allergy/AN00693">Cold urticaria</a> is a very real, very annoying condition which I won't talk too much about (utilizing the 'ignore it and it will leave' philosophy of health), suffice to say that I've never had it before and I wish it would go away.

I read <a href="http://www.gladwell.com">Malcolm Gladwell's</a> <em>Outliers</em> over the break (twice). It's decent, although Gladwell writes a little too much like a self-improvement author when one of the main messages of his book is that some people are just more lucky than others. In any case, it did inspire me to make the most of the opportunities I've been given. To start off with, I'm going to try to adhere to a 24-hour per week drawing schedule. I've thought about this, and it will take five 3-hour days, and two 4.5-hour days (the days I have drawing class). I suppose I'll update about that later? If I'm not drawing too much...

Also, it's 2009.
