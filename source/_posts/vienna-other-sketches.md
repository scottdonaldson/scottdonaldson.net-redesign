I gave my sketchbook to a few of my other group members to keep them entertained one night. What I got back was, to say the least, shocking, controversial, and perhaps one of the most important pieces of contemporary art of which I've ever been a part. If you're curious about who exactly these "other group members" are, you can find most of them (and some other pictures, better than the ones you'll find here) on <a href="http://sdcarpenter.free.fr/paul/wien/">Paul's website</a>.

And now, to get to the drawings that may change the world, read on, deeper into the belly of the beast. I labeled on the drawings who did what, so be sure to consult Paul's site for portraits of the artist in question.

It seems like this work has a lot to say about the personalities of each artist. Paul created on the left an ethereal, otherworldly atmosphere, reflecting his desire to experience more than this world can offer. I recommend hallucinogens. Hannah Robinson then encased his space with a number of outlines. What I believe this means is that she's a protector, a motherly figure, perhaps, who looks after those close to her, and is always willing to sacrifice her self if it benefits others. She also drew a kinda cool tree. Jon drew in strong, brutal swaths of color that unapologetically draw attention to themselves, even covering up Hannah Goodwin's work in the process. Jon is an "alpha male," who comes out on top no matter the situation. Hannah Goodwin also drew a significant part of this next picture:

Hannah's drawing is pretty cool. This one Jon did not dominate.

Here's Naomi's drawing:

I believe the tree and leaves were Naomi originals. I definitely made the red thing at the bottom that sort of resembles a nipple. I think I was trying to show something about watercolor technique? Either that or I was drawing a nipple. Anything is possible.

I guess the point of this post is that everyone else in my Vienna group should probably drop their current majors and become Studio Art majors.
