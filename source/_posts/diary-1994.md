I just got home from school a few days ago for Thanksgiving, and will be leaving soon. Earlier, while cleaning out my room a bit, I discovered (the only) two pages from the first journal/diary I ever tried to keep. Every few years or so, I'll try writing in one regularly, which inevitably fails. The one I found dates from the balmy summer of 1994, when I was six years old (almost seven, actually). I think it offers a lot of insight into my now long-gone childhood. I'll try to punctuate and spell exactly as I found it (slashes indicate that I wrote the words too close together, and wanted to show that they were separate words).
