        <p>This post describes the process and ideas behind visualizing data from Wikipedia using Snap.svg. Not the nitty-gritty.</p>
        <p>If you're looking for that, the full code for this project is available on <a href="https://github.com/scottdonaldson/dfe/invisibles.js" class="ext" target="_blank">GitHub.</a></p>
        <p>I recently worked with Design for Equality on the Invisibilities project, a discussion and edit-a-thon meant to highlight "architects, movements, ideas or project that have been dismissed, forgotten, or discriminated against by the discipline of architecture" in the digital realm.</p>
        <p>The gender gap in Wikipedia's editors (reported by <em>The Atlantic</em> in 2013 as being 90% male) has recently come <a href="http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/02/closing-wikipedias-gender-gap-reluctantly.html" target="_blank">under</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/31/business/media/31link.html?_r=0" target="_blank">scrutiny</a>. As a widely used source of information on the Internet, this leads to a bias with a tremendous impact.</p>
        <p>For the Invisibilities project, we wanted to illustrate the imbalance by showing the difference in edit activity (how often a Wikipedia page is updated) for different pages &mdash; notably between architects and designers of different genders.</p>
